# Cosmose - Jetpack Compose Playground
Simple Jetpack Compose demo gallery. Not intended for production use.

## Explanation
This simple app is meant to contain various demos of things built with Jetpack Compose. From games to UI elements, this app will be a playground for me to learn, experiment and share my findings.

**Pull requests are welcome!**

## How to run
If you're here, you probably already know how to run a Jetpack Compose app. If not, here's a quick guide:

1. Clone the repo
2. Open the project in Android Studio (you will likely need the latest Canary build, but do what you want, I'm not your dad)
3. Run the app on a device or emulator.
